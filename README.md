I am **DUDDUKURI MAHESH** working as a FullStack Js Developer in INDIA and i am passionate about the computer technologies.Here i want to create a Best Platform (Node.js with hapi.js) for Node.Js developers to increase their devlopment process. 

   **hapi** (**Web and services application framework**) is a simple to use configuration-centric framework with built-in support for input validation, caching,
